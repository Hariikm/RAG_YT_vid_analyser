      "[Document(page_content='Back in 2015, Apple introduced the 12-inch\\nMacBook. The first model ever to feature an Apple logo\\nthat didn’t light up. And since then, the MacBook Pro and MacBook\\nAir have also received the same treatment. This caused some controversy, since the glowing\\nApple logo has been around for over two decades and has become an iconic design element of\\nApple’s notebooks. So why was the illuminated Apple logo removed? Well, that’s exactly what I’ll explain\\nright now. So when the 12-inch MacBook was introduced,\\nit was the thinnest model in Apple’s history. In fact, at 13.1 millimeters, it was 24% thinner\\nthan the MacBook Air. But that dramatic improvement didn’t come\\nwithout compromises. For example, Apple had to create a new super-thin\\nkeyboard that featured butterfly mechanisms instead of the traditional scissor design. They claimed the new keyboard was an improvement,\\nbut that didn’t turn out to be the case. It was extremely faulty and resulted in a\\nclass action lawsuit, with Apple eventually reverting back to the scissor keyboards. But another compromise of the 12-inch MacBook\\nwas the non-illuminated Apple logo. Since the display was so thin, two problems\\narose. First, if there was a strong light source\\nbehind the display, you could actually see a subtle hotspot in the center of the screen. Since the glowing Apple logo was a transparent\\ncutout that allowed the display’s backlight to shine through, but also allowed external\\nlight to enter. This meant using the MacBook outside could\\ncause color inaccuracies on the display. So to eliminate this potential issue, Apple\\nhad to seal off the display’s chassis entirely, which meant getting rid of the translucent\\nlogo. But there was another benefit to this approach,\\nthe thinness of the MacBook’s display combined with the Apple logo cutout, caused structural\\nrigidity issues. Just like the iPad Pro was easily bent thanks\\nto the Apple Pencil attachment cutout, the MacBook could’ve easily been bent due to\\nthe Apple logo cutout. So replacing its weak spot with a piece of\\nmetal, helped eliminate this structural weakness. The third reason why Apple got rid of their\\nglowing logo is for purely aesthetic reasons. Back when the trend started in 1999 with the\\nPowerBook G3, Apple was mounting a comeback. Steve Jobs had just returned to the company\\nthree years prior, and he put a huge focus on establishing a new reputation for Apple. Since they’d fallen out of favor with customers\\nover the past decade. That’s what sparked the Think Different\\nad campaign, and radical new computer designs like the iMac and PowerBook. It was the first time a glowing Apple logo\\nhad been used, and it was crucial in creating brand awareness. Seeing a prominently displayed Apple logo\\nin public reminded people that the company was still around, and was actually creating\\nsome really cool products. But today, Apple has been moving away from\\nthis overt brand strategy and shifting to something more subtle. For example, they could’ve put an Apple\\nlogo on the AirPods Max, like almost every other headphone manufacturer, but they didn’t. Also, with the 24-inch iMac, Apple removed\\ntheir logo from the product’s chin for the first time since 2004. And it makes sense why they don’t need their\\nlogo to be as overtly display anymore. Apple isn’t struggling to garner attention\\nor win customers from other brands. They’re by far the biggest and most recognizable\\ntech company in the world. With almost every product they create dominating\\ntheir respective market. Apple has also been unifying their product\\ndesign in recent years. And since the iPad, iPhone, and Mac desktops\\nall have non-illuminated Apple logos, it makes sense to carry that design language through\\nto the MacBook line.

      "This is from answer_question fn:     [Document(page_content='Back in 2015, Apple introduced the 12-inch\\nMacBook. The first model ever to feature an Apple logo\\nthat didn’t light up. And since then, the MacBook Pro and MacBook\\nAir have also received the same treatment. This caused some controversy, since the glowing\\nApple logo has been around for over two decades and has become an iconic design element of\\nApple’s notebooks. So why was the illuminated Apple logo removed? Well, that’s exactly what I’ll explain\\nright now. So when the 12-inch MacBook was introduced,\\nit was the thinnest model in Apple’s history. In fact, at 13.1 millimeters, it was 24% thinner\\nthan the MacBook Air. But that dramatic improvement didn’t come\\nwithout compromises. For example, Apple had to create a new super-thin\\nkeyboard that featured butterfly mechanisms instead of the traditional scissor design. They claimed the new keyboard was an improvement,\\nbut that didn’t turn out to be the case. It was extremely faulty and resulted in a\\nclass action lawsuit, with Apple eventually reverting back to the scissor keyboards. But another compromise of the 12-inch MacBook\\nwas the non-illuminated Apple logo. Since the display was so thin, two problems\\narose. First, if there was a strong light source\\nbehind the display, you could actually see a subtle hotspot in the center of the screen. Since the glowing Apple logo was a transparent\\ncutout that allowed the display’s backlight to shine through, but also allowed external\\nlight to enter. This meant using the MacBook outside could\\ncause color inaccuracies on the display. So to eliminate this potential issue, Apple\\nhad to seal off the display’s chassis entirely, which meant getting rid of the translucent\\nlogo. But there was another benefit to this approach,\\nthe thinness of the MacBook’s display combined with the Apple logo cutout, caused structural\\nrigidity issues. Just like the iPad Pro was easily bent thanks\\nto the Apple Pencil attachment cutout, the MacBook could’ve easily been bent due to\\nthe Apple logo cutout. So replacing its weak spot with a piece of\\nmetal, helped eliminate this structural weakness. The third reason why Apple got rid of their\\nglowing logo is for purely aesthetic reasons. Back when the trend started in 1999 with the\\nPowerBook G3, Apple was mounting a comeback. Steve Jobs had just returned to the company\\nthree years prior, and he put a huge focus on establishing a new reputation for Apple. Since they’d fallen out of favor with customers\\nover the past decade. That’s what sparked the Think Different\\nad campaign, and radical new computer designs like the iMac and PowerBook. It was the first time a glowing Apple logo\\nhad been used, and it was crucial in creating brand awareness. Seeing a prominently displayed Apple logo\\nin public reminded people that the company was still around, and was actually creating\\nsome really cool products. But today, Apple has been moving away from\\nthis overt brand strategy and shifting to something more subtle. For example, they could’ve put an Apple\\nlogo on the AirPods Max, like almost every other headphone manufacturer, but they didn’t. Also, with the 24-inch iMac, Apple removed\\ntheir logo from the product’s chin for the first time since 2004. And it makes sense why they don’t need their\\nlogo to be as overtly display anymore. Apple isn’t struggling to garner attention\\nor win customers from other brands. They’re by far the biggest and most recognizable\\ntech company in the world.
